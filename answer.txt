Code 2 is a better way to code the component.

Because in Code 1, the onClick event listener is attached to the parent <div> element, which means that clicking anywhere inside the parent <div> will trigger the event while in Code 2, the onClick event listener is attached to each individual <div> element generated by the map() function, which means the event is only triggered when clicking on a specific animal element.
In one word, Code 2 provides a more focused and maintainable approach to handling the click event for individual animal elements.
